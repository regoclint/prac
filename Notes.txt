Graph representations
    Edge list
    Adjacency List
    Adjacency matrix
    HashMap of HashMaps
    List of other neighbour Graph Nodes & node lookup HM

Graph BFS or DFS doesnt matter if its undirected or directed

Shallow copy - contains references to the copy from element
Deep copy - New objects are created

Fail-fast - fail earlier in the process. Iterator fails fast incase of concurrent modification
Use iterator to remove elements while iterating over a list
To Remove from list - break after removal or use iterator to avoid comod error

An array list can be printed directly without looping
HashSet can remove duplicates from objects also cuz of equals() definition

For count of all permutations DP
For list of all pnc backtrack
