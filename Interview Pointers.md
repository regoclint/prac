Product stuff

- Postman test suite
- Performance tuned
    - open connections reduced spring. Session factories were created multiple times and missing close()
    -  
    - Backend APIs - Object mappers, logs, n3 complexities, 
    - Build time - admin ui dev, h2 db, Unit tests rewrite 
    Frontend - Tweaked long polling in maximus activity page on a condition
    Jenkins build - h2 db and multi thread
    
    

Dev stuff
- Chrome extension
- Admin ui development time
- Jrebel

Challenges
- Postman testsuite
- Long polling was bad, suggested websockets, settled with long polling with a condition
- Performance on discovery API, did the research
- Collaborating with multiple teams for Pna, learning and imparting
- Suggested refresh token and access token be done automatically in SDK
- Looking into core stack code and fixing bugs
- LiveReload
- Tech debt
    - Open sessions, converted sessions to JPA

    
faced something and how did u improve
    Performance PnA
Faced some issue and had to redo
    Design changes SB

Strengths
- Curiosity, improving performance, solving problems, finding solutions and improving experiences, reducing efforts

My questions
-What would be the project, tech stack, location, volume of users

1. Open company, no bullshit
How have you had to have difficult conversations and what was your approach to this?
- Pna Run time optimisation, explain to dev, then manager then my manager
- scalability of Pna
- Sudha content aux code duplication
- Activity polling based on a condition


How have you resolved conflict situations?

Have you had to adapt your communication style to achieve a better outcome in a potentially negative situation?
-Stay Calm, hear completely and 'we'


2. Dont f the customer
How is your mentality ‘user centered’?
How have you put the customer first? What trade-offs did you have to make to do this? For example: Ship late, but ship right?

-Response times, 
-customer behaviours through clickStream
-Loading indicators during n/w calls
-confirmation on deletion
-Localization
-Indicators or info symbols to explain


3. Be the change you seek
How did you influence to push for change? What did you learn from this process? What was the outcome?

-Postman test suite
-Chrome extension
-Macros

4. Play as a team
How have you helped make a team/individual more successful if they were not performing well? Examples of when you have had to put the goals of the team above personal ambitions.

Admin ui development
mock simulators
formatter
spring boot live reload
h2 db
batch writes to improve performance



5. Build with heart and balance
Prioritization and decision making - balancing decision making for example late night deployments to hit business goals vs risks associated with doing that.


Questions
-How values influence work
-Hows shipit
-No sales team, how does that work out

-Sharepoint -Confluence main competitor

LP
1. Customer obsession
handled difficult customer, understand customers needs
- postman test suite, not able to test without access
- built pna
- the link of price update

2. Ownership
Went above and beyond, Peer struggle, 
- Postman test suite
- admin dev time (Peer struggle)
- h2 db
- activity refresh ui tweak 
- simulator setup from dev (Peer struggle)

3. Invent and simplify
invent, improvements, simple solution to complex problem
- postman testsuite (invent)
- chrome ext (invent, improvements)
- admin dev stuff (simple)
- simulator setup from dev (simple)
- formatter (improvements)
- h2 db 

4. are right a lot
made a bad decision, disagreed with a colleague, decision in the absence of data
- push back SB PnA (disagreed)
- caching pna(first in the absence of data)
- implemented pna in both code (bad decision)
- disagreed with Sudha on common code for content aux

5. Learn and be curious
what can u teach me in 5 mins, influenced change by asking questions, solved by observation
- postman testsuite, macros in excel, chrome ext, jrebel (teach)
- variable in singleton n big decimal (observation)
- buyer exception thrown (observation)
- caching in pna (by asking questions)

6. Hire and develop the best
hired someone smarter, how u ensure u hired best person, 
- guide junior developers and not give them solutions even tough I knew/could do so 
- person was getting tired of the question (higher best)


7. Insist on highest standards
something u wish u did better, improved quality of something already good
- excessive logs
- admin dev stuff
- performance on discover api
- accenture (wish had done better)
- chrome ext and formatter and h2 (improved) 


8. Think Big (Common)
big risk and failed, beyond scope and delivered, radical approach taken, how did u drive adoption, 
    saw an opportunity to do something much bigger than the actual scope 



9. Bias for action
calculated risk when speed was critical, get info from someone unresponsive

10. Frugality
get more out of less, worked with limited time or resources


11. Earn trust
contributed to improving moral, got critisized what did u do, tell someone else a harsh truth, convince someone who is resisting what u are trying to do
- admin stuff made other build tools
- wrote a simulator for a colleague
- common code for contentaux

12. Dive deep
data to develop strategy, large problem u helped solve 

13. Have backbone: disagree and commit
someone didnt agreee, conflict, unpopular descision, u disagreed, challenging situation

14. Deliver results
exceeded goal, most complex problem, worked on something extremely hard and failed
